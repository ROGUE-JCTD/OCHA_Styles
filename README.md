OCHA_Styles
===========

This is a repository of the OCHA-specific files, of which there are 17 different layers, each with several layer types. We have folders for both English and Spanish related layers. Each layer folder has Shapefiles, SLDs, and schema. These layers are created from the OCHA Humanitarian symbol set. 

The symbols were provided by OCHA at Reliefweb: http://reliefweb.int/map/world/world-humanitarian-and-country-icons-2012.
